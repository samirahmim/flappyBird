# flappyBird
In this side-scrolling endless runner game, the player
controls a bird that must fly between sets of pipes. Any other
movement causes the bird to flap its wings; the player may only
control the bird’s vertical movement. If the bird touches a pipe or
the ground, the game is finished. The player’s goal is to gain life so
that they can play the game farther. In the VScode environment,
this game will be developed using three.js, HTML, CSS, and
javascript
